In this tutorial we will explore how classes work, and look at tips and tricks for getting the most out of them.

You are expected to already have a good grasp on functions and dictionaries. More advanced topics are discussed in the [second notebook](./Classes_II.ipynb).

    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is based around the concept of *[objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science))*, which in turn are usually generated by *[classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming))*. The philosophy of OOP is generally summarised by four core concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)) - *only showing certain features to the user*\n",
    "* [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) - *grouping together certain features*\n",
    "* [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)) - *reusing and extending features*\n",
    "* [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) - *allow objects to take various forms*\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main benfits that OOP provides, which are directly linked to these core concepts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **reusability** - *minimising the amount of copying and pasting of code*\n",
    "* **maintainability** - *minimising the amount of code that needs to be changed to fix a bug*\n",
    "* **security** - *minimising the amount of misuse by a user*\n",

Specifically, you want to know the radius (in $\\textrm{km}$) at the equator, the mass (in $\\textrm{kg}$) and the gravitational acceleration at the surface (in $\\textrm{ms}^{-2}$). There are obviously many different ways of doing this. The simplest (in terms of coding) would be to define a variable for each parameter."
